# EBYTE E80-x00M2213S Module

This repository documents my study and implementation of the EBYTE E80-x00M2213S module.

## Project Contents

### KiCAD v8 Resources
- [Module Footprint](KiCAD/E80-x00M2213S.kicad_mod)
- [Modificated STEP FILE](docs/E80-XXXM2213S_U.step), add pins

> **Important Note:** The dimensions between pin8/pin11 and pin16/pin19 are shown as 11.17mm in the official STEP model, which differs from the 11.20mm specified in the user manual. Please verify these measurements with your actual module before designing your PCB, as I haven't physically measured the module myself.
